# flashcard_generator

OVERVIEW

For this project, I created a flashcard generator. It works from the backend. 

There are two different versions.

- Basic
- Cloze

BASIC Flashcards have a front and a back (much like real flashcards) where the question is on the front and the answers is on the back. 

A CLOZE Flashcard is simply a statement where some of the statement is missing so the user has to guess by input on what the complete statment is.

Everything is done on the command line.

BASIC
For my basic, I did an NBA theme.

To run the basic flashcards, the user will type "node BasicCard" on the command line.

The app will reveal the first question. For example, here is one of the questions

![](/images_for_readme/02_question_for_basic.png)

After the user has input all their answers, the app will tell them if they got the question right or wrong. Since I did an NBA theme, the user will know if they got it right or wrong by the context of the response after all the flashcards are done.

CLOZE

For the Cloze, I mixed it up with some pop trivia.

To run the cloze flashcards, the user will type "node ClozeCard" on the command line.

The app will reveal the first statement that is missing something that the user must guess.

The user must fill in what is supposed to be in the 3 periods.

...

After the user has input all their answers, the app will tell them if they were able to successfully complete the statement correctly.
